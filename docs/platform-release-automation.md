# Platform Release Automation

This repo stays the source of truth for the shared web app. On each published release, it updates the public TizenBrew module repository and dispatches a private webOS build that uploads the `.ipk` back to the matching GitHub release here.

## TizenBrew

- Add the public module repository name to the `TIZEN_REPO` GitHub Actions variable in this repo, for example `your-org/NuvioTVTizen`.
- Add a `REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret in this repo with permission to push commits to that repository.
- When a release is published here, `.github/workflows/release-platform-artifacts.yml` checks out the public Tizen repo, builds the shared app from the release tag, syncs the generated module files, and commits the update with a release-based commit message.
- The synced Tizen module does not commit live env values. Its generated `app/nuvio.env.js` bootstraps env from `https://nuvioapp.space/nuvio.env.js` by default, or from `window.__NUVIO_TIZEN_ENV_URL__` if you override it.
- TizenBrew then consumes the updated module directly from the public GitHub repository.

## webOS

- Create a private GitHub repository for the local folder `/Users/edin/Documents/NuvioTV/NuvioWebOS`.
- Add the repository name to the `WEBOS_REPO` GitHub Actions variable in this repo, for example `your-org/NuvioWebOS`.
- Add a `REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret in this repo with permission to trigger workflows in that private repository.
- When a release is published here, `.github/workflows/release-platform-artifacts.yml` dispatches a `build-release` event to the private repository.
- The private repository checks out this repo at the release tag, runs `npm ci` and `npm run build`, then runs `npm run sync:webos -- --path <wrapper-repo-root>` against the checked out source.
- The private repository packages the wrapper with `ares-package` and uploads the generated `.ipk` back to the same release in this repo.

## Private Repository Secrets

Each private platform repository should define:

- `MAIN_REPO_RELEASE_TOKEN`: token with `contents: write` access to this repo so the workflow can upload assets to releases.

## Local Test Flow

From this repo you can generate the webOS wrapper contents locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run sync:webos -- /Users/edin/Documents/NuvioTV/NuvioWebOS
```

That writes the built app into the private wrapper repository and refreshes `index.html`, `appinfo.json`, and the wrapper icons there.
